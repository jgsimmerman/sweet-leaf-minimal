story: "Calathea zebrina (the Zebra Plant) is a an evergreen perennial from Brazil."

---
<em><strong>Calathea zebrina</strong></em> (the Zebra Plant) is a an evergreen perennial from Brazil. This species likes to be indoors when temperatures dip below 61 degrees F. Normal room temperature inside is ideal. These plants prefer bright indirect light and will not do well in full sun. Soil should be kept moist in Summer and does not like to dry out. Plants enjoy a shower with luke warm water when possible. Fertilize twice a month during the growing season from Spring to Fall. Misting is also beneficial, as this plant likes humid surroundings.

Plant will arrive in a 2.25 inch pot, fully rooted and will be roughly 6" - 9" tall from the soil line. In maturity, plant can grow to be up to 3 feet tall. With proper care, leaves can eventually grow to 18 inches in length.

When plant arrives: Carefully remove from box and cut out of bag. Remove any paper or packaging material gently, as it will be packed between leaves to prevent crushing. Water thoroughly.

<strong>SHIPPING</strong>

<em>ITEMS SHIPPED MON, TUES and sometimes WED</em> (if you are close). At this time of the year, we highly recommend a heat pack if anywhere between my area and yours will be below 45 degrees. Heat packs are listed as a shipping upgrade for $4.00 each.

One or two plants ships for $6.50 for First Class and each additional plant will be $1, until you have reached Priority rate or $8.90 for priority no matter how many you purchase. Add .80 cents for insurance and purchases over $35 ship free! If shipping takes longer than three days to get your plant with First Class shipping, I will email you to determine if you want to upgrade to priority.

<em>Regardless of what shipping time says, all plants are shipped on Mondays and Tuesdays</em> (sometimes Wednesdays if you are close)!! You may order a plant on Monday and see that the expected date for shipping is on Thursday, but your plant will go out on Tuesday, unless you placed you order prior to 2 pm. Most orders placed prior to 2 om will go out same day. Occasionally we will ship a plant on Wed if you are close, but we ship primarily on Mondays and Tuesdays so that the plants arrive prior to the weekend and are not sitting in a post office all weekend. Plants should arrive between one and three days from the Monday after your order, and all plants are shipped Priority USPS.

<strong>RETURNS / REFUNDS</strong>

All sales are final. <em>However</em>, if your plant arrives in a damaged condition that it will not recover from, please contact me within 48 hours with photos so that I can submit a claim with USPS. All priority shipping comes with insurance from USPS. If USPS covers the claim, then I can provide you with another plant or send you a refund. USPS does not always cover items that were delivered. If you would like additional insurance that will cover claims of theft, etc then please upgrade insurance during shipping for an additional cost of .80. This is not required, but is easier to make a claim with if your problem is not the fault of the USPS, such as theft. If you plant comes out of the pot during shipping, while annoying, the plant should be fine, We take every precaution to ensure that your plants will arrive safely and still potted, including bagging, wrapping, cushioning and providing heat packs, but we have no control over what happens once it leaves our care. Please contact me with any issues to attempt a fair resolution for all and contact me with any questions you have about care.

<strong>WINTER SHIPPING</strong>

If the temperature in your area or mine is below 45 degrees, we recommend a heat pack. If your area is going to be extremely cold, then you may need two heat packs. Heat packs are $4 each. If you do not want to include heat packs during cold weather, then you take full responsibility if your plant freezes. We may check the weather between South Carolina and your location, and send a message to recommend adding a heat pack, or to offer to change your shipping date to ensure safe arrival. You will have until the 2 PM to add a heat pack before we ship it without one. We do not leave our plants outside for the post office to pick them up and instead take the plants to the post office before the truck comes to pick up the packages for the day at 330pm so that they are not sitting outside in the cold. We want to provide you with the highest quality plants possible and between our cost and the extra added cost of shipping, we don't make any money on the heat packs and simply provide them as a service to ensure your plants arrive safely.

If you have any questions, I would be happy to answer them, not only about the listing but also about the care of your plant after you get it. My inbox is always open and I am happy to help!
