story: "One of the easiest pitcher plants to grow. Plants come potted in a 3.5 inch square plastic pot with pure long fiber sphagnum moss, so it is ready to go and doesn't need to be repotted in a different medium. These would be considered large starters are their leaves span between 9 inches and 12 inches at the largest point. Plants have an average of five or six pitchers."

One of the easiest pitcher plants to grow. Plants come potted in a 3.5 inch square plastic pot with pure long fiber sphagnum moss, so it is ready to go and doesn't need to be repotted in a different medium. These would be considered large starters are their leaves span between 9" and 12" at the largest point. Plants have an average of five or six pitchers.

<strong>Care:</strong> These plants will not need to be repotted for several month after arrival. When repotting, plant in pure long fiber sphagnum moss or long fiber moss and perlite (50/50 ratio). These plants like a growing medium without fertilizers or nutrients and get what they need from the bugs in their pitchers.

Mist twice a day and keep moss moist at all times but not sitting in water. Water and mist with rainwater, reverse osmosis water or distilled. DO not feed meat, such as ground beef. Allow plants to eat bugs that they catch on their own, or give them a fresh insect once a month or so when large enough. When left outside they will typically catch everything they need. When removing dead pitchers, cut off at the tendril and allow the leaf to stay until it dies.

<strong>When the plant arrives:</strong> Carefully remove from box and cut out of bag. Remove any paper or packaging material gently, as it will be packed between leaves to prevent crushing. Water thoroughly and mist pitchers. They love bright, indirect sunlight. If temps allow, you can put it outside in bright indirect sunlight or keep in a window sill protected from drafts. Nepenthes need to come inside when temperatures fall below 55 degrees.
